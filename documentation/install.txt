* NOTE: As of OES3.0.3, the upgrade file contains all updates from 3.0.0, so you no longer need to apply 3.0.1, then 3.0.2 etc.
If you already have a version of OES for PHP installed, you should download the oes3.x.x_upgrade.zip file as it only contains the files which have changed. See the upgrade.txt file for more information.

Note: please ensure the register_globals option on your PHP installation is set to off. This should be the default on any recent installations. OES will not run correctly with the register_globals set to On. You can override the PHP setting by adding "php_register_globals off" to the .htaccess
file in the OES root directory.

1) Unzip the distribution file.
2) FTP or copy the directory structure contents to your PHP server. After doing this, ensure that the
		'includes/dbconfig.php' file has permissions that allow the installation routine to write to it.
3) Navigate to admin.php in your browser. This will automatically detect that installation is required and
		will prompt for installation parameters. The installation routine that runs depends on whether the OES
		database already exists and, if it does, whether it is empty, contains a migrated copy of the Access
		database from the ASP version of OES (see upgrade.txt) or whether it is an up-to-date version of the
		database (copied from another PHP server for example).
4) After the installation completes, you'll either be shown a status page describing what the installation
		routine did and allowing you to proceed to the admin login page, or you'll be taken directly to the
		admin login page.
5) Login with username: admin and password: password.
6) The administration menu is shown. You will need to work through the items from top to bottom as outlined in
		the administration section of the user manual.
7) After you're happy with the installation, you can set the permissions
		of 'includes/dbconfig.php' so that it is no longer writable.
8) If you are intending to use the Offline Admin Application, download that as well.
9) When you're satisfied that everything is working correctly, you should remove the following scripts (these were only
required during installation or are for debug purposes):-
	databaseinstall.php
	install.php
	test.php
	version_test.php

TinyMCE and uploading images and files for the content management system
If you want to use the functionality within TinyMCE to upload, manage and link to files on your web server, you need to edit the CONFIG_WEBSITE_DOCUMENT_ROOT setting within the scripts/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/ajaxfilemanager/inc/config.base.php file. This should be set to the value produced by running the dirname(__FILE__) PHP statement in the root web directory of your server.
